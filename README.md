Abstract

Quantum Computing has the ability to do computations that classical computers can not compete with. On the other hand, classical computers still have skills that can outpreform quantum computers in a multitude of ways. Since both are powerful in seperate ways, ultilizing a Hybrid quantum-classical Neural Network allowed both of their strengths to be haressed. The objective of our project is to use this type of machine learning to identify if a patient has pneumonia. This program allows error correction in real life as well as within the project, offering a second opinion to doctors as well as saving time diagnosing patients.
